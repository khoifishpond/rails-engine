# Rails Engine

This project imagines a scenario where I a working for a company developing an E-Commerce Application. My team is working in a service-oriented architecture, meaning the front and back ends of this application are separate and communicate via APIs. My job is to expose the data that powers the site through an API that the front end will consume.

## Learning Goals

* Expose an API
* User serializers to format JSON responses
* Test API exposure (with Postman)
* Use SQL and ActiveRecord to gather data
